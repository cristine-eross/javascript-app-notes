A few ideas for this notes app:

I chose to create two very similar cards for both the input field and the saved notes.
When writing the functions, we will actually need 4 button onclick event functions:

-initial save function: the save button on the input type of card does not only set a new attribute for the textarea (readonly) but it creates a new card into the container, gives that the input value and saves the data to local storage; we also need to empty the textarea after that
-additional save function: after enabling the textarea and after changing the content, this should overwrite the previously saved data to the new one, give that to its container and set readonly attribute again
-edit function: removes the readonly attribute from the textarea
-delete function: removes the card div and its content from local storage

In order to make these functions work, what we need to grab from the html are:
    init-save-btn
    add-save-btn
    edit-btn
    del-btn
    card div
    textarea
